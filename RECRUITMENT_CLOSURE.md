- **Flexible Messages**: Customizable closure messages
- **Date Management**: Easy to update opening/closing dates

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Controllers
- `app/Http/Controllers/ApplicationController.php` - Added recruitment status checks

### Views/Components  
- `resources/js/pages/Application/Closed.tsx` - Enhanced with countdown timer and mobile responsiveness

### Configuration
- `config/recruitment.php` - New configuration file for recruitment settings
- `.env` - Added recruitment environment variables

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables (`.env`)
```env
# Recruitment Settings
RECRUITMENT_OPEN=false                           # Manual override
RECRUITMENT_OPENS_AT="2025-12-05 00:00:00"      # Opening date/time
RECRUITMENT_CLOSES_AT="2025-12-20 23:59:59"     # Closing date/time  
RECRUITMENT_CONTACT_EMAIL="spesusc.hrm2026@gmail.com"  # Contact email
```

### Config File (`config/recruitment.php`)
```php
'is_open' => env('RECRUITMENT_OPEN', false),
'opens_at' => env('RECRUITMENT_OPENS_AT', '2025-12-05 00:00:00'),
'closes_at' => env('RECRUITMENT_CLOSES_AT', '2025-12-20 23:59:59'),
'contact_email' => env('RECRUITMENT_CONTACT_EMAIL', 'spesusc.hrm2026@gmail.com'),
'closed_message' => 'SPE Suez Student Chapter recruitment is currently closed.',
'committees_closed_message' => 'Applications are currently closed. All committees have reached their capacity.',
```

## 🎯 Current Settings
- **Recruitment Status**: ❌ CLOSED
- **Opening Date**: **December 5, 2025** at 12:00 AM
- **Closing Date**: December 20, 2025 at 11:59 PM
- **Contact Email**: spesusc.hrm2026@gmail.com

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. **Route Access** (`/apply`)
When someone visits the application route, the system:

1. **Checks Manual Override**: If `RECRUITMENT_OPEN=true`, allows access
2. **Checks Date**: If current time is after `RECRUITMENT_OPENS_AT`, allows access  
3. **Shows Closure Page**: If recruitment is closed, shows closure page with countdown
4. **Checks Committees**: If recruitment is open but all committees are closed, shows different closure message

### 2. **Closure Page Types**

#### **Recruitment Closed** (`type: 'recruitment_closed'`)
- 🕒 **Clock Icon** with amber/orange gradient
- ⏰ **Live Countdown Timer** with colorful time blocks
- 📅 **Reopening Date** prominently displayed
- 🎯 **"Recruitment Opens On"** section with excitement
- 🔔 **"Get ready!"** notification box

#### **Committees Closed** (`type: 'committees_closed'`)  
- ⚠️ **Warning Icon** with red gradient
- 📝 **"Applications Currently Closed"** message
- 🚫 **No countdown** (immediate closure reason)
- 📞 **Contact information** for inquiries

### 3. **Countdown Timer Features**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Updates every second
- **Colorful Blocks**: Different gradient colors for each time unit
- **Mobile Responsive**: 2x2 grid on mobile, 1x4 on desktop
- **Client-Side Rendered**: Prevents hydration issues
- **Auto-Refreshes**: When countdown reaches zero, page needs manual refresh

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Design Features
- **Adaptive Icons**: Smaller icons on mobile (`w-12 h-12` → `w-16 h-16`)
- **Flexible Grid**: Countdown timer adjusts from 4 columns to 2x2 on mobile
- **Touch-Friendly Buttons**: Proper spacing and touch targets
- **Readable Text**: Font sizes scale appropriately
- **Centered Layout**: Everything centered and properly spaced

### Breakpoints Used
- **Mobile**: < 640px (sm)
- **Tablet**: 640px+ (sm)
- **Desktop**: 768px+ (md)

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Color Schemes
- **Recruitment Closed**: Amber/Orange gradients (hopeful, coming soon)
- **Committees Closed**: Red gradients (definitive closure)
- **Countdown Blocks**: Blue, Purple, Pink, Red gradients
- **Action Buttons**: Blue gradients with hover effects

### Interactive Elements  
- **Hover Effects**: Scale and shadow animations
- **Active States**: `active:scale-95` for touch feedback
- **Smooth Transitions**: 300ms duration for all animations
- **Loading States**: Proper client-side rendering handling

## 🔧 Management Instructions

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Cases to Verify
1. ✅ **Visit `/apply` when recruitment is closed** → Should show closure page with countdown
2. ✅ **Countdown timer accuracy** → Should update every second and show correct time remaining
3. ✅ **Mobile responsiveness** → Should look good on phones, tablets, and desktops
4. ✅ **Contact email link** → Should open email client with correct address
5. ✅ **Navigation buttons** → Should work to homepage and about page
6. ✅ **Manual override** → Setting `RECRUITMENT_OPEN=true` should bypass date check
7. ✅ **Committee closure fallback** → If recruitment is open but committees closed, show different message
